     * <p><b>Implementation Considerations</b>
     *
     * <p>The ability to interrupt a lock acquisition in some
     * implementations may not be possible, and if possible may be an
     * expensive operation.  The programmer should be aware that this
     * may be the case. An implementation should document when this is
     * the case.
     *
     * <p>An implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over
     * normal method return.
     *
     * <p>A {@code Lock} implementation may be able to detect
     * erroneous use of the lock, such as an invocation that would
     * cause deadlock, and may throw an (unchecked) exception in such
     * circumstances.  The circumstances and the exception type must
     * be documented by that {@code Lock} implementation.
     *
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is
     *         interrupted while acquiring the lock (and interruption
     *         of lock acquisition is supported).

     *
